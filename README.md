# CNN Model for Card Detection (Keras)

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras to detect and classify different types of playing cards from image data.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Input: Images of playing cards
- Model: Custom CNN architecture built with Keras
- Output: Predicted class (e.g., heart, spade, club, diamond)

## 📁 Dataset

You can use or create your own dataset with labeled images of playing cards. Recommended sources:
- Your own photos
- Public image datasets (Kaggle or OpenML)

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
2. Open `CNN_model_for_card_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook step-by-step to load data, train, and evaluate the model.

## 📊 Results

The trained CNN can classify card images with reasonable accuracy. Model performance will vary based on the dataset and preprocessing techniques used.
